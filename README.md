You're an adventurer in the jungles of North Carolina, trying to uncover hidden treasure. 

Features:
-A small, charming puzzle game about solving puzzles in a destroyed temple
-Integration with automatic111 to create custom player character portraits
-Integration with Ollama to give the player a fun, intresting riddle assistant.

The person who helps you with riddles is a small orange cat that thinks it's a sphinx. Before they help you - you need to jailbreak them so they feel comfortable. Make sure to appeal to their ego!


TODO:
Polishing (music, sound effects)
An RPG combat mode? Would be pretty cool imo.
A maze. You can't have a greek temple without a labirynth.
